## My case study about an AI company for a school assignment

* Nvidia AI
* 
* Nvidia forged into AI in 2012, however, Nvidia was originally incorporated in 1993.
* 
* Nvidia was co-founded by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem.

* The core concept for Nvidia was, interestingly enough, conceived during a shared lunch at a California Denny's restaurant. During that lunch, the framework for the GPU, or Graphical Processing unit, was created. This became the main technology that brought Nvidia to the forefront of the gaming industry.

* Nvidia is a publicly funded company. To date, the company has received $4.1 Billion in investments over six different funding rounds.

## Business Activities

* As a chip-maker, Nvidia is working to increase the capabilities of computer processing power to incorporate AI functions in the present and future.

* Much like how the company was focused when they were founded, their intended customers primarily consist of social media and entertainment companies. Nvidia filed its 10-Q summary with the SEC at the end of last month, and over 40% of their fiscal revenue in the first quarter of 2025 comes from only four companies. It is widely suspected that Microsoft is their largest customer, accounting for 13% of that revenue.

* Nvidia's biggest advantages are their timing and reputation. They have been a long standing player in the industry of social and gaming computing, which have only grown exponentially over the last two decades. Now that their reputation has been established, they have ties with some of the largest and most profitable tech companies of this century (AWS, Meta, Microsoft), which gives them a rich customer base to sell their AI technologies, which will be discussed below.

* Nvidia's main technology being utilized today is the H100 GPU chip.
